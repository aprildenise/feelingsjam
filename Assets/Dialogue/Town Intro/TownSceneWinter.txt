Winter: Oh, Zel, nice to see you finally out on New Years.
Zel: Hey, Winter.
Zel: (Ice cold. Just like her choice of colors.)
Winter: Finally getting the help you need?
Zel: ...No.
Winter: Ah, alright then. You'll come around eventually. You'll need to anyways. 
Winter: When you want to get rid of THOSE.
Zel: What?
Winter: Your wings, Zel. They're holding you back.
Zel: (...You don't know that.)
Winter: Anyways, your "friends" are inside.
Winter: Don't keep them waiting.
