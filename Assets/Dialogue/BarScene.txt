A Villager: Oh, Zel's here.
A Villager: What? Really?
A Villager: I'm impressed...
A Villager: ...Right? Never thought she could do it.
A Villager: Do you think she'll finally loose her wings?
A Villager: Probably not.
A Villager: I'm surprised to see her!

A Villager: Don't say that!
A Villager: She's doing her best.
A Villager: ...I can't wait until she actually changes...
Zel: ...Maybe it wasn't time for me to come out yet.
Lee: Zel, is that you?
Zel: ...Maybe it wasn't time for me to come out yet.
Lee: ...Are you alright?
Zel: Ugh, I can't let them see me like this! I'm too embarrassed and nervous now! I'm going home!
