Zel: Today was awful...
Zel: I'm glad to be home though.

Zel: ... These are the times I want to run away
Zel: find a better home than this one, and be free.
Zel: My wings are meant for that anyway.

Zel: But the moment I stop running away, my wings will fall off.
Zel: I know it's better for me.
Zel: But I don't know if I want to take that step...
Zel: I don't know if I can yet.
